This will keep my notes on transcriptomics coding sessions!

Today we started the Transcriptomics module of the course!!!!

We began by looking at raw data files, which can be found here:

-   `/gpfs1/cl/ecogen/pbio6800/Transcriptomics/RawData`

We then chose our samples (mine is C1) and edited the bash script, titled `fastp_tonsa.sh`.
